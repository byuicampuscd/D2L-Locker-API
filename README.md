Write to a users locker to store a file. See http://docs.valence.desire2learn.com/res/locker.html

The js file was writen by Jay Hanson, the html file was written by Joshua McKinney. There are good things about both. In the end a js file is what we want. Then need to be merged, keeping the best of both.
